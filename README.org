* Comparesoft Coding Challenge
This repository is taken from an internal email notification that runs on AWS via the serverless framework. This service listens for messages from a number of SQS queues and SNS topics, then forwards them on as emails.

Some users have reported that certain internal notifications are too noisy, and they would like to mute certain notifications.

E.g. We get a notification when users perform certain events, however we are not interested in some users; so we would like to ignore emails about those events without ignoring all of those notification types.

For this challenge just the mute code is included, you can assume that the email generation part is working as expected.

Your task is to complete the implementation of the mute functionality, with tests, and apply any fixups to the code that you see fit.

Tests can be run with ~make test~
